# Lissajous Knots JS #

### About

Visualization of Lissajous knots using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) framework. 

DEMO: https://fredrikredin.github.io/LissajousKnotsJS/.

A [Lissajous knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_knot) is one that can be parameterized by a single cosine function in each coordinate. Lissajous knots are highly symmetric, and for this reason, not all knots are Lissajous.


### p5.js

> "p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web. Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you're not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch."
